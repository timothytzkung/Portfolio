            <div class="project-description">
                <p>This complaint filing web application was developed to help students track and voice ongoing issues within our university department. From curriculum organization and course availability to campus life and community engagement, the platform allows users to raise concerns, engage in discussions, and view trending topics. By centralizing complaints and feedback, the app aims to promote transparency, encourage dialogue, and support meaningful improvements across the department.</p>                
                <p>My role in this project was to design the user experience flow and map the user journey from our group's research. Then, I was tasked to prototype the experience first in Figma before creating a high fidelity prototype using HTML/CSS.</p>

                    <h3>Challenges</h3>
                    <div class="project-description">
                        <p>One of the major challenges we encountered in the early stages of design was selecting a color scheme that aligned with SFU's visual identity while maintaining a clean and user-friendly interface. Striking the right balance was tricky — some initial drafts featured colors that either felt too bold and distracting or didn't harmonize well with each other. Additionally, inconsistencies emerged in the visual elements, such as a mix of rounded and sharp corners, which made the interface feel disjointed and less cohesive.</p>
                        <p>Another significant challenge stemmed from the text-heavy nature of the application itself. Since the platform focuses on discussion threads, complaints, and feedback, we needed to design a layout that presented large amounts of information without overwhelming users. Ensuring that the interface remained accessible and easy to navigate, while still surfacing relevant content, was a key design consideration.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Solutions</h3>
                    <div class="project-description">
                        <p>To address the visual inconsistencies, our team made a collective decision to adopt a more uniform aesthetic. We standardized elements such as corner shapes, button styles, and typography, which helped create a smoother and more cohesive user experience. We also fine-tuned the color palette to complement SFU's branding while keeping it subtle enough to avoid visual clutter.</p>
                        <p>Ongoing peer feedback played a crucial role in refining both the functionality and layout of the app. Through testing and discussions, we gathered helpful suggestions — for example, swapping out the original “Popular” section for alternative filters like “Unanswered” or “New” to encourage more engagement with less visible posts. We also adjusted the placement of interface elements, such as relocating sorting dropdowns, to establish a clearer visual hierarchy and improve overall usability.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Technical Implementation</h2>
            <div class="project-description">
                <p>The frontend of the application was developed using vanilla HTML and CSS, allowing us to build the interface from the ground up without relying on external frameworks. For styling, our team created custom CSS modules tailored to each component, which helped us maintain organized and modular styles across the application. This approach made it easier to manage and update individual sections of the interface without impacting unrelated components.</p>
                <p>Before development, we designed the overall layout and interface in Figma. Prototyping in Figma allowed us to visualize the user flow, experiment with design iterations, and ensure alignment on the visual direction before translating it into code. Once the designs were finalized, we implemented the layout using a combination of CSS Grid and Flexbox. These CSS techniques gave us the flexibility to create a responsive layout that adapts seamlessly across different screen sizes and devices, ensuring a smooth user experience whether accessed on desktop or mobile.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Lessons Learned</h2>
            <div class="project-description">
                <p>This project was my first experience collaborating on a larger codebase with multiple team members at the same time. One of the most valuable lessons I gained was the importance of using version control tools like Git. By leveraging Git, we significantly reduced the amount of manual code merging and updating between teammates, which helped keep our workflow organized and minimized the risk of overwriting each other's work.</p>
                <p>Additionally, I realized how crucial it is to gather feedback earlier in the design and prototyping phases. In this project, feedback often came later in the process, which sometimes led to us having to roll back versions or rework features. Moving forward, I plan to prioritize sharing prototypes and gathering user or peer feedback earlier and more frequently. This will help ensure we catch potential issues sooner and reduce unnecessary revisions down the line.</p>
                <p>Lastly, I learned the importance of establishing clearer roles and responsibilities within a team. Our group occasionally ran into overlaps in tasks, which led to inconsistencies in both the quality and visual style of our product. For future projects, I plan to advocate for more clearly defined roles at the outset. This should help maintain consistency, streamline communication, and allow each team member to focus on their strengths to produce a more cohesive final result.</p>
