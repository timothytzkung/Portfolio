            <div class="project-description">
                <p>This complaint filing web application was developed to help students track and voice ongoing issues within our university department. From curriculum organization and course availability to campus life and community engagement, the platform allows users to raise concerns, engage in discussions, and view trending topics. By centralizing complaints and feedback, the app aims to promote transparency, encourage dialogue, and support meaningful improvements across the department.</p>                
                <p>My role in this project was to design the user experience flow and map the user journey from our group's research. Then, I was tasked to prototype the experience first in Figma before creating a high fidelity prototype using HTML/CSS.</p>

                    <h3>Challenges</h3>
                    <div class="project-description">
                        <p>One of the early challenges I identified was the lack of visual consistency across our initial UI drafts. Some components used sharp corners while others were fully rounded, which made the interface feel disconnected. Additionally, while trying to incorporate SFU's brand colors, we initially leaned too heavily into bold tones that ended up clashing and distracting from the content. I realized that without a more unified design system, it would be hard for our interface to feel polished or intentional.</p>
                        <p>Another challenge arose from the platform's inherently text-heavy nature. Because the app centers around user-submitted complaints and discussions, we had to find a way to present dense information without overwhelming users. I noticed that without clear hierarchy and spacing, it became difficult to scan or prioritize content, especially on smaller screens. This issue directly impacted usability and readability.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Solutions</h3>
                    <div class="project-description">
                        <p>To address the design inconsistency, I took the initiative to create a small internal style guide outlining standard corner radii, button styles, and spacing conventions. I also suggested toning down our color palette to better reflect SFU's visual identity without overpowering the user interface. By documenting these guidelines and walking the team through them, I helped set a more cohesive visual foundation moving forward.</p>
                        <p>To tackle the content density problem, I designed several low-fidelity wireframes focused on information hierarchy. I proposed breaking content into clearly labeled sections with consistent spacing and modular components, which made the interface easier to scan and digest. When we received feedback suggesting alternative post filters like “Unanswered” or “New,” I mocked up how these changes would look and shared usability insights to support their implementation. I also recommended repositioning interface elements like the sorting dropdown to help clarify the user's navigation path and reinforce a clean visual hierarchy.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Technical Implementation</h2>
            <div class="project-description">
                <p>While the frontend was built using vanilla HTML and CSS, I took responsibility for organizing our styling approach. I introduced CSS modules for component-based styling and helped structure our codebase to support modularity and maintainability. I also worked on setting up the base layout using CSS Grid and Flexbox, ensuring it aligned with our Figma prototype and responded properly across different screen sizes.</p>
                <p>To support the team, I translated the Figma designs into a set of reusable layout patterns and shared annotated examples to help my teammates implement consistent spacing, alignment, and responsiveness. Whenever styling conflicts or layout bugs came up, I stepped in to debug and refactor problematic sections of the CSS, helping maintain visual consistency and a clean user experience across the app.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Lessons Learned</h2>
            <div class="project-description">
                <p>This project was my first experience collaborating on a larger codebase with multiple team members at the same time. One of the most valuable lessons I gained was the importance of using version control tools like Git. By leveraging Git, we significantly reduced the amount of manual code merging and updating between teammates, which helped keep our workflow organized and minimized the risk of overwriting each other's work.</p>
                <p>Additionally, I realized how crucial it is to gather feedback earlier in the design and prototyping phases. In this project, feedback often came later in the process, which sometimes led to us having to roll back versions or rework features. Moving forward, I plan to prioritize sharing prototypes and gathering user or peer feedback earlier and more frequently. This will help ensure we catch potential issues sooner and reduce unnecessary revisions down the line.</p>
                <p>Lastly, I learned the importance of establishing clearer roles and responsibilities within a team. Our group occasionally ran into overlaps in tasks, which led to inconsistencies in both the quality and visual style of our product. For future projects, I plan to advocate for more clearly defined roles at the outset. This should help maintain consistency, streamline communication, and allow each team member to focus on their strengths to produce a more cohesive final result.</p>
